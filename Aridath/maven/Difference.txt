# Difference between Maven and Gradles

# 1- Gradle is faster than Maven: The main goal in Gradle is to add functionality to the project;
#    meanwhile the main goal in Maven is related to the project phase.
#    Maven allows us to override dependencies, but only by version.
#    Gradle tracks input and output and runs only the tasks that have been changed.
